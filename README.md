# PHP-Password-Reset-URL-Creator

Allowed my system users to visit the URL and change password on their own. Much better security then the previous system of having users email their new passwords to the administrators.

Ofcourse, this is very basic crypto functionality, but it serves the purpose with encryption, and salting.

No point in hashing for AD passwords, but ofcoure, that is a good feature for your website's database.
